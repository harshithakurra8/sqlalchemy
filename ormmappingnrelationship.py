 

#ORM Mapping and Relationships: 

#Learn how to map Python classes to database tables using SQLAlchemy's ORM. 

#Explore different types of relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. 

#Create Python classes for Account, deposits and withdrawals. 

#Create tables in postgres using alembic migrations. 



#SQLAlchemyâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows you to map Python classes to database tables, 
#making it easier to interact with the database in an object-oriented way.
#You can also define relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
